<p>I like having vim-like bindings and prefer running programs in the
terminal for simplicity's sake. That said, I'm very much against the
cringey meme that things in the terminal are &quot;cooler&quot; or &quot;nerdier&quot;
XD. Terminals are good for most tasks, but useless for others, for
example, browsing the modern web (I admit this unfortunate fact with
much consternation) or looking at maps or images or modifying videos by
NLE. I do do some image/video editing with <code>imagemagick</code>/<code>ffmpeg</code>, but
only simple, repetitive tasks.</p>

<dd>I use Artix Linux 
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVc6n5aOzy0">vid</a>/<a href="https://artixlinux.org/">site</a>)
which is a fork of Arch Linux except for without systemd. You can
see some of my reasons for using Arch-based distros
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bsNIdYw5Ak">here</a>.
Linux distributions are generally not distinct enough to have strong
feelings about, hence the reason I only rarely care to talk about
them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zpgQpdy_fI">You can see my opinion on Linux distributions generally
