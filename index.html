<p>I like having vim-like bindings and prefer running programs in the
terminal for simplicity's sake. That said, I'm very much against the
cringey meme that things in the terminal are &quot;cooler&quot; or &quot;nerdier&quot;
XD. Terminals are good for most tasks, but useless for others, for
example, browsing the modern web (I admit this unfortunate fact with
much consternation) or looking at maps or images or modifying videos by
NLE. I do do some image/video editing with <code>imagemagick</code>/<code>ffmpeg</code>, but
only simple, repetitive tasks.</p>
